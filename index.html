        <p>Julie Hodges is a Texan with a rich background in science, education, and problem-solving. She graduated summa cum
          laude with a B.S. and A.A. from John Brown University and an M.S.S.W from UTA</p>
        <p>After many years as a science teacher, she is looking to move into the world of coding with an emphasis on crypto-assets.
          She is currently super lost in coding, but hopes to improve soon. She spent an inordinant amount of time on google
          trying to become familiar with html and css semantics.</p>
        <p>Fortunately, with the help of amazing T.A.'s, fabulous classmates, w3schools, and google, she was able to get a decent
          page.</p>
